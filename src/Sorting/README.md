# Sorting

### Sorting Algorithms

1. Quick Sort
2. Heap Sort

#### Linear Time Sorting 

These algorithms assume something about the data there is to sort. (not universally fast)

1. Radix Sort: Sorts numbers by sorting them by digit, starts with the least significant digit
2. Counting Sort: Assumes each element x_i âˆˆ {0,...,k} where k is given to the algorithm.
3. Bucket Sort: Assumes the input is drawn from a normal distribution.
