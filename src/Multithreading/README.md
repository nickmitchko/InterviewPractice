# MultiThreading

Many algorithms are **serial algorithms** meaning that they are suitable to run on uni-processor architectures.
These algorithms are the fastest possible algorithms available when a process can run only one instruction at a time.
However, it would be hard to find any commercial processor made in the past twenty years that is a uniprocess.
In fact, your smart-phone processor may be able to handle 64 concurrent threads. This is a mathematical extension for multithreaded processors.
